  <h2>Reactive Orders</h2>

  <p class="cursive">
    When the opposing player declares a charge order, an un-engaged unit can declare a reactive order by spending the
    required CP.
    All reactive orders are carried out before the order they are reacting to.
  </p>
  <p class="cursive">An engaged unit cannot declare any reactive orders</p>

        <p>Allows the unit to move its normal movement distance with the condition that it must end movement further
          away from the charging unit.</p>

        <p>After the flee move, the charging unit must be moved 3" towards the fleeing unit.</p>
        <p>After these moves have been completed, the charging unit must calculate its remaining movement as such:
          charge movement - 3 = remaining movement.</p>
        <p>If the fleeing unit is within distance of the remaining movement (still accounting for terrain), the charging unit must complete its charge
          against it and move into base contact.
          If not, you check to see if there's any enemy units within the remaining movement distance (accounting for terrain), if so, the
          charging unit can choose to redirect its charge to this unit for no additional CP cost.</p>
        <p>
          If the charge was redirected, you perform a new charge against this unit with the remaning movement as the charge distance, this new target can then as well
           perform a flee reaction if so desired.
        </p>

        <p>If the player chooses not to redirect the charge, the charging unit does not move any further and its activation ends.</p>

        <p>If a unit is engaged while fleeing, it will fight with a -2/-2 modifier and its defence is decreased
        by -2/-2/-0.</p>

        <p>A fleeing unit must be given a rally command before being able to function normally again. A fleeing unit which
        is not given the rally command at the start of a turn will continue to flee its normal movement away from the
        nearest enemy model at the begin turn step.</p>
