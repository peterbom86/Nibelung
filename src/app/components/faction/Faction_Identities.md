# Faction Identities

This document describes each of the different design philosophies that goes into each of the factions in the game.

## Factions

### Noble Elves (Blue)
- Powerful units, heroes that support the units
- Powerful magic with a focus on control (moving, trapping etc enemies)
- Might be hesitant to act? Intrigue?
- Can have trouble being overrun by multiple enemies, too many to control

### Sanguine Court (Black)
- Powerful heroes and monsters, units that support the heroes
- Gains extra points for destroying enemy units
- Magic focus on debuffing enemy
- Their backbone units is reliant on necromancers, if these are taken out, the frontline of units can crumble
- A theme of self-harm in order to gain benefits, could be reducing the HP of your encampment for some benefit - or killing or reducing HP on own units for a benefit.

### Despoilers (Red)
- Merciless, does not care about the life or death of their own units, sometimes even prefer death
- Mix of strong self-sufficient units and heroes
- Destroys objectives for points
- Offensive
- Magic focus on dealing direct damage
- Can have trouble with being controlled and tar-pitted
- The faction best suited for destroying enemy encampment - and this is not a rare victory condition for them

### Knightly Realms (White)
- Weak units (Men at Arms) that gets stronger by being in close proximity to the Knights
- Lots of overlapping aura effects
- Defensive, about preserving their units
- Can have trouble taking down very strong single units

### Wood Elves (Green)
- Controlling terrain
- Caring less about traditional objectives (enemies might not even get full points?)
- Hit and Run tactics
- Powerful units and heroes
- Can have trouble holding ground
- Wants to delay the game by using hit'n'run tactics during the early and mid-game, then using their ramped resources to recruit massive forest creatures to
  stomp the enemy in the late game,
- Quite bad at assasinating the enemy encampment, except maybe very late game where they can run rampant.
 
# Magic identities of each of the factions

## Black
- Discard/terror/destruction (destruction of enemy resources, could be units, ability to cast certain spells or CP/MP/Req. points)
- Evasion (some black creatues are so terrifying that you cannot engage them in direct combat)
- Regeneration (ability to keep units alive or ressurect them)
- Lifelink (ability to strengthen itself by eliminating opponents)
- Sacrifice (both self for gaining advantages and forcing it upon the opponent)
- Weaknesses (lower health for all units on the table)

### Ally color spells
- Direct damage spells, but as damage-over-time, so a slower version of the red direct damage spells.

### Enemy color abilities
- Destruction of own resources (trade units for mana - opposite of green ramp)

## Blue
### Primary
- Counterspell (either cheaper ways to counter spell, greater range on where you can counter or something similar?)
- Illusions (create an illusion of a unit, at any point in the future (when the unit is engaged or about to score objectives, you decide which one is the real unit and which is illusion) - illusion disappears when engaged)
- Tactical options (spells for generating extra CP)

### Ally colors spells
- Lockdown of units (borrowed from both black and white, but a weaker version since it doesn't remove units, only locks them down for a period of time)

### Enemy color abilities (opposite ability of enemy colors)

## White
- 'inprisonment' control of enemy units - effectively taking them out.

## Green
Ramping of resources (extra Req. Points)
hit-n-run

### Ally colors spells
- Spells that deal direct damage, but based around the units you have on the table, they are somehow needed to deal the damage.

## Red
- Direct damage spells


### Enemy color ability
- Spell for generating MP by sacrificing CP (opposite of blue tactical options)






### Other armies I haven't decided on yet
